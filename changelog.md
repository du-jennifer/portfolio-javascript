For my site updates, I fixed the links style in all media version (destop, media, tablet) so that the font colors aligned with my site. I also fixed it so that when I hover it, the font is black. Additionally, I also added all my educational videos to my teaching page from YouTube using iframe. I also added all the experiences I had to my website (experience page). Lastly, I completed the "Hover Smile Then Click Me" button in the contact page using Javascript. Now, it will display a happy cat picture and a line that says "Have a good day ^-^" after clicking the button. I also adjusted this function to fit to all media sizes (destop, media, tablet).

I added Google Analytics to my website as my 3rd party script. I added this script in order to track movement on my site. Through this addition, I will be able to track where my visitors are coming from and see which pages on my site they are interested in. This way, I will be able to better cater my site to my visitors. I will also know the retention rate and why visitors are leaving my site. With the bounce rate in mind, I will know how to better improve my site. I will also know the devices and general information of my visitors and better optimize my website based on this information.
